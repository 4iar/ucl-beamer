UCL LaTeX Beamer theme

by Simon Byrne (based on the original template by Maurizio Filippone)

These files form a theme for the Beamer package in LaTeX that is a close
approximation to the UCL Corporate Identity. The usage of the theme and its
options are given in the file show.tex.

To use once, simply put the files in the directory of your document.

A more permanent solution is to put the files somewhere in your texmf tree. To
find out what this is in your system, type the command:

  kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME

An appropriate place would be <texmf>/tex/latex/uclbeamer
